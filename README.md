## **A Little Bit About Me**
Greetings! I am Nirjhar, a second-year Computer Science undergrad at Georgia Tech. This summer, I am interning as a software engineer at AT&T's Chief Security Office in Dallas, Texas!

Outside of school, you can see me tinkering with various projects, such as websites, chatbots, and VR games. I also spend a lot of time scuba diving, experimenting with new foods, and playing catch-the-laser with my cat, Miu!

## **My Commitment towards Protecting YOUR Data**
On the homepage, there is a "contact me" form that collects the user's name, email address, phone number, and their message for me. The Google Firebase SDK is used to retrieve this data and store it in an online database that only I can access. *Therefore, any information that you input into my website is safe and secure with me and will not be distributed to other entities without **your written/electronic consent**.*

## **JavaScript Software Development Kits (SDK) and Libraries**
* [**Google Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/): Used to retrieve user's data from a contact form and store it in a secure Realtime Database that can only be accessed by me.
* [**SMTP.js**](https://smtpjs.com/): Used to send me and the user an email containing a .txt file of the user's contact information.
