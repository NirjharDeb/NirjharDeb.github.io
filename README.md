## **A Little Bit About Me**
I'm a student majoring in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. As an Indian-American who has lived outside the U.S. for over a decade and traveled across the world, I have been fortunate to interact with individuals from various countries, communities, and cultures. My hobbies include cuddling with my cat and exploring the depths of the ocean!
